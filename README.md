# Collaborative Get-to-Know Project by Group 4

## Project Description

Welcome to our group project! We used a Markdown template repository to create a
collaborative `group4-Intro` repository. Our main goal is to practice working
together in a shared space AKA GitHub.

For this project, each member added one markdown file to the repository, which
made it an enjoyable and interactive experience as we got to know each other
better. âœ¨
