### Code example

Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it
and then sums the results together. For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return
9

```javascript
function squareSum(numbers) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    result += numbers[i] * numbers[i];
  }
  return result;
}
```
